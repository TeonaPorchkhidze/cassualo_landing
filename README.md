# **Cassualo - Find Balance Between the Digital and Real World** 🌐🌍

## **Abstract**

App where real connections happen.🤝 **No news, ads, or influencers.** It’s all about meeting like-minded people for real-life activities like going out for food, attending events, playing chess, or anything you enjoy. Powered by psychology and machine learning 💖

## **Reasons and Values**

Every new popular social network shapes society differently, builds new habits in people, and creates new human behaviors that we have never seen before. In the last 50 years, after internet connection became available to everyone, human-to-human connection shifted from the physical world to a more digital one.

🤷‍♀️ **Is this the best type of communication for biological/physical creatures?**

You can answer this question yourself because, if you are reading this, you’re probably already part of it.

I don’t like to be too radical and say this is **100% bad** 😢, and what I offer is **100% good** 😂. I wanted to offer something that invites balance into our lives between the digital and real world.

In the last several years, I have actively observed social media platforms like **Facebook**, **X**, **Tinder**, **Telegram**, **WhatsApp**, **Instagram**, **TikTok**, **Rednote**, **Threads**, and so on. I didn’t want to forget naming any of these.

I realized some things I seriously didn’t like on these platforms and wanted to create something I would use myself. An app for myself. I observed my interest levels and decided to create a template for people who look like me on these platforms and feel the same way, so we can have a space. Trust me, I’m not that unique. 🌺🔥

We spend a lot of time in the digital world and on social media 😢, because everything is there 💥 — from shops to friends , to news , to influencers , to advertisements , to our favorite products , and so on.

I wanted to make this app a little more relaxed.

**No ads**,  
**No news**,  
**No influencers**.  

I want to be present. 🌱 I want to attend concerts without worrying about taking pictures to show others that I attended or proving something to someone. I don’t want to think weekly about what I should post next. 👀🤯💥

If I use a digital communication platform, it better be highly comfortable for chatting — nobody beats 🥊💥 **Telegram** in this. But Telegram is a little boring, and exploring new people isn’t interesting.

No need to post constantly; this is another rule in the app.

But you know… I can’t chat 24/7 with people, even if it’s a comfortable chat. I want real-life communication and access to interesting people with the same interests because that’s exciting for me.

🤨😳 **Modern dating/friend-finding apps have terrible algorithms.**

I can’t find anyone there who is similar to me, except my boyfriend. I spent more than a year in the app to find someone perfect for me, which is crazy, 🤯 and I was an active user.

They just want you to scroll. So I need some innovative algorithms, probably machine learning-based, to find perfect human connections based on **psychology** 💻🧠.

The thing is, I don’t like labels. When I register on an app and it tells me “**find friends**” or “**find your love**,” I feel pressured, like, “What the heck?” I want something more chill.

That’s why I decided to create something for casual connections — **Cassualo** 🦋.

## **And how does real life fit in?** 👁️

We make finding people fast by using a **machine learning human compatibility algorithm** based on psychology. And our goal is not to have 9 hours 🕒 of screen time because we make it fast and also suggest **food spots** 🍕🍔🍣 and **real-life events/activities** 🏃‍♂️🏀🎨 where you can find and go with your pair/pairs/community.

So, the goal is to find people 🔍 and get out into **real life**. 🍃
